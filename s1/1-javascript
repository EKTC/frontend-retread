### Javascript

- Browsers do not yet support all of JavaScript's newest features
- Due to this fact, a lot of code run in browsers has been transpiled from a newer version of JavaScript to an older, more compatible version
- Today, the most popular way to do transpiling is by using Babel. Transpilation is automatically configured in React applications created with Vite.
- Node.js is a javascript runtine environment
- You can open a nodejs console by typing `node`

### Variables

```js
const x = 1;
let y = 5;

console.log(x, y); // 1 5 are printed
y += 10;
console.log(x, y); // 1 15 are printed
y = "sometext";
console.log(x, y); // 1 sometext are printed
x = 4; // causes an error
```

- const means it becomes immutable and we cannot change the value for that variable
- let allows us to change it whenever as it is mutable
- Javascript is loosely typed so we do not need to define the variable type but rather just initialise it
  - Hence why we can switch the `y` variable which is an `int` to a `string` without errors
- `var` is also a keyword used instead of `let & const` before but is now only used for older browsers
