### Basics

- The idea of HTTP GET is the browser requests some resources from the server and then waits for it to present the relevant information
- When we call an event handler, the code will create the environment or the process, but the browser invokes the function when needed
  - An example of this is something like an onclick : we define the idea of it but only execute when we click on that element
- Document Object Model (DOM) is how the browser determines the elements of a webpage and can be thought of as a tree of elements
  - This allows us to insert elements in certain positions based on the tree
- The idea of HTTP POST is when there is some user input or update to the data and the code sends that back to the server and causing a rerender to change the webpage based on the new data
- AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is the idea of fetching content to webpages using JS without needing to rerender the page
